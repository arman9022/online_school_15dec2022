Hello,

I need a website for online learning.

Which includes how to enter a written text and also has a multiple choice variant.

-It should:

- an admin panel with its own access e.g. schoolonline.com/adminlogin (so no one logs in accidentally)
- only the first lesson should be free for testing, after that it is chargeable and 
   must be purchased with 2 options once for 1 year and once lifetime prices changeable
- a teacher panel with its own access, e.g. schoolonline.com/teacherlogin
- a student panel
- a login with encrypt variant
- it should be displayed what the student has already done in "%"
- Students should be able to be assigned to the teacher
- After the last question there should be a list with all answers listed above which are wrong it should show in "%" of all 
   questions are correct
- In the admin panel it should be possible to create and delete students as well as create / delete teachers, 
  and it should also be possible to create new lessons
  and can ask the questions and choose whether there is a written text to enter or is a multiple choice.
- A payment provider should be integrated e.g. Fastspring ( Since the company is based in Bosnia )
- A contact form directly to the admin
- Forgot Password feature is required
- Darkmode change should be there
- Questions / chapters should be able to be inserted and deleted in the admin center


- Design are provided with pictures

HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, NODE JS, MYSQL is required.

Can you imagine doing this task?

Please write an approximate cost estimate for your site right away, as the project is scheduled to begin soon.
